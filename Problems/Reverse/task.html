  <p>In this task, we predefined a list <code class="java">numbers = [2, 4, 6, ...]</code>. Below we also present the code which is supposed to choose elements with indices <strong>from 4 to 16 inclusively in reverse order</strong>, but a mistake has been made. Find and fix it.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-272').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-272" style="display:none;">
   With a negative step, your start index should be greater than the stop index. Choose the stop index carefully. Due to reverse order, you might want to decrease it by one in order to include the last element in your slice.
